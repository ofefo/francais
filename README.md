# fran√ßais

Intended to help me learn the language, this script takes the text from a random wikipedia article, prints it and then reads it with French pronunciation.

### Installation

To install it, run: `./install.sh` (it will create a virtualenv for the dependencies).

Then you can try it with: `francais`
