# fran√ßais

Intended to help me learn the language, this script gets the text from a random wikipedia article, prints it and reads it with French pronounciation.

### Installation

To install it, run: `./install.sh` (it will create a virtualenv for the dependencies).

Then you can try it with: `francais`
